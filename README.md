## Project Description

"What's for Dinner" is an open-source web application that suggests recipes based on the ingredients and cooking utensils you have on hand. With our platform, you can search for recipes using specific ingredients, add or remove ingredients to see different recipe suggestions, and save your favorite recipes for future use. Our app also includes advanced search filters such as dietary restrictions, meal type, and cooking time/difficulty to help find the perfect recipe for users at all levels.

### Product Vision Statement

"What's for Dinner" is an app that helps users save time, reduce food waste, and enjoy the cooking process by providing optimal recipe suggestions based on the ingredients available.

## History of the Project

We are a team of college students, and often after grocery shopping we have a few leftover ingredients that we don't know how to use or use effectively. Therefore, having an application that can help with giving us an optimal recipe based on the available ingredients can be very helpful in saving time, producing less waste when cooking, and enjopying the process.
